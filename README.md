Blur-Extension-Examples
=======================

This project includes a few more advanced extension examples including the Calculator Page and Blur Info Page.

Please note that these won't compile and run on Blur right out of the box. They do not have the manifest tags necessary because they are packaged directly with Blur. We just specify the names and packages manually from within the page and card pickers. These should be used more as a reference. If you would like to change and test with them, you can just take what is needed from this project and put it into the hello world example projects. Change what is necessary in the manifest, then build the project and it will be selectable from within Blur's settings. They are set up to run correctly, just don't have the correct structure to be shown from Blur's settings.

What's included:
- Blur Info Page
- Blur Calculator Page

- A Weather Card
- A "Next Alarm" Card
- An Events Card



As I said, these should be used more as a reference as advanced examples. Some more advanced than others. To get started, I would use the Klinker Apps Hello World Blur examples:
Hello World Card: https://github.com/klinker-apps/Blur-Hello-World-Card
Hello World Page: https://github.com/klinker-apps/Blur-Hello-World-Page

These will be much easier to build and learn off of.


If you have any questions, feel free to email us:

We will do our best to get back to you and answer any of your questions.

Cheers and enjoy Blur!
